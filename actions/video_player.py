"""
Play a video where the avatar normally is.

The HUD already had a surface for this — the live camera takes the centre of
the screen and gives it back — so a video is the same idea with a different
source, and it shares the same stack rather than inventing a second one. That
means the avatar, the camera and a video can never be on screen together.

WHAT IT ACCEPTS
    a local file        C:\\Users\\me\\clip.mp4, ~/Videos/holiday.mkv
    a direct media URL  https://example.com/trailer.mp4
    a YouTube link      https://youtube.com/watch?v=...
    a YouTube search    "play the new Dune trailer"

    The first two are handed straight to Qt. The last two have to be resolved
    to something playable first, which is what yt-dlp does; without it, this
    says so and offers to open the video in the browser instead of failing.

SOUND IS OFF UNTIL ASKED FOR
    A soundtrack talking over the assistant is the one way this feature could
    make YAMK worse rather than better, and the microphone is open while it
    plays. So it starts muted, and the user turns sound on — from the button in
    the video header, or by saying so. Closing it works both ways too.
