"""
One place where the assistant's one-shot Gemini calls are made.

WHY THIS EXISTS
    The live conversation runs on the Live API and is not what this file is
    about. Everything else — reading a screenshot, parsing a flight page,
    turning a request into a shell command, working out which WhatsApp button
    answers a call — was a separate `genai.Client(...)` built at the point of
    use, with the model name written inline. Sixteen files did it, twenty-six
    times, and not one of them set a timeout.

    That is not tidiness, it is three real faults:

    NO TIMEOUT.  The SDK waits forever by default. `gemini-flash-latest` spent
    an afternoon returning 504 DEADLINE_EXCEEDED, and every one of those calls
    became an unbounded hang — measured at ten seconds of silence while a phone
    rang, and worse elsewhere, because nothing was there to give up.

    NO FALLBACK.  One hardcoded alias meant that when that alias was unwell,
    the feature was simply gone. A ladder costs nothing when the first rung
    works and saves the feature when it does not.

    NO SINGLE PLACE TO CHANGE.  A new model release meant editing sixteen files
    and hoping none were missed.

THE LIVE MODEL DOES THIS WORK, AND IT LEADS THE LADDER
    Not the user's conversation — a separate, throwaway session per call, so
    nothing a plugin asks is ever heard by the person at the microphone.

    It leads because of quota. This is a voice assistant; the Live API is the
    dependency it already has, and it draws on a different pool from the text
    models. On the free tier it is the TEXT pool that runs out, and when it does
    every side call fails and the feature behind it dies with it. Putting Live
    first means ordinary use stops spending the pool that runs dry.

    The reply arrives through output_transcription, because these models refuse
    response_modalities=["TEXT"] with a 1007 — they only speak. That sounds
    fatal for structured output and is not: the transcription is the model's own
    text of what it said, and it returned "Mum ❤ click here for contact info",
    indented Python inside markdown fences, and src/utils/helpers_v2.py
    character for character.

    It cannot carry grounding metadata, so grounded web search stays on REST.

THE LADDER, MEASURED
    Live, one throwaway session:
        connect                     0.24s
        short structured JSON       1.7 - 2.8s
        2300 characters of code     3.39s, not truncated
        three concurrent sessions   all fine, 4.77s wall clock
    REST text models, same prompt, same afternoon:
        gemini-2.5-flash-lite       0.76s   ...then 429, quota exhausted
        gemini-2.5-flash            0.80s   ...then 429
        gemini-flash-lite-latest    2.58s
        gemini-flash-latest         504, every time
    So REST is two to four times quicker while it lasts, and the whole point of
    the ladder is that it does not last. Pinned REST names sit behind Live;
    rolling `-latest` aliases sit behind those, because they were the ones
    having a bad day.

    Where the answer depends only on stable input, cache it and neither pool is
    touched twice: `plugins/_whatsapp_core.py` is the worked example — one
    request per WhatsApp language for the lifetime of the install.

# A rung that means "ask the Live model instead", through a short throwaway
# session rather than the REST text API.
#
# WHY IT LEADS
#     This is a voice assistant: the Live API is the dependency it already has,
#     and it draws on a DIFFERENT quota pool from the text models. On the free
#     tier the text pool is the one that runs out — an afternoon of ordinary use
#     exhausts it, and when it does, every one of these side calls fails and the
#     feature behind it dies. The Live pool is untouched by that.
#
# WHAT IT COSTS, MEASURED
#     connect                      0.24s
#     short structured JSON        1.7 - 2.8s   (REST: 0.76s)
#     2300 characters of code      3.39s, not truncated
#     three concurrent sessions    all fine, 4.77s wall clock
#     So it is two to four times slower than REST when REST is available, and
#     infinitely faster than REST when REST is out of quota.
#
# THE THING WORTH KNOWING
#     These models only speak — response_modalities=["TEXT"] is refused with a
#     1007. The reply comes back through output_transcription, which sounds like
#     it would mangle anything structured. It does not: it is the model's own
#     text of what it said, and it survived "Mum ❤ click here for contact info",
#     indented Python inside markdown fences, and src/utils/helpers_v2.py
#     character for character. That is what makes this usable at all.
#
#     What it cannot carry is grounding metadata, so grounded web search stays
#     on REST — see SEARCH.

# live-translate and a robotics streaming model, none of which are assistants

# used before it, which is known to work here. A mismatch in config is already
# survivable — the connect loop drops the tuning and proactive-audio fields and
# reconnects when the server rejects them.
